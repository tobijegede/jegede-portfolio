# Summary of Changes From Part 2




## Things to Change from Part 2 :

The key improvements needed for my final presentation that I noted from my user research were the following:

Fix the colored, bolded parts of the endowment definition and other callouts throughout the storyboard to a dark orange or other non-red color to make the callouts easier to read.
Fix the map by either eliminating it or selecting a clearer reference/comparison point. Also, add a clearer title to the map.
Include links to articles by news organizations showing how endowments are spent/invested OR highlight that this information is typically not disclosed. This was a common critique among the interviewees and so there needs to be some anticipation of this question and some kind of answer provided for the reader, even if it is just that such detailed information does not exist.
Find potential non-profits or other examples of organizations that readers can donate to instead of giving money to their alma maters.
In the GDP comparison table, add a label inside of each of the mini bar charts. Also, add additional countries for comparison. Finally, add a comprehensive title to this table. OR Change the GDP comparison table to a series of infographics instead of a table.
Make the titles for the graphics story points instead of basic descriptions to better highlight the main point of each of the visualizations.
Adjust the color scheme to potentially use a white background instead of a blue background.
Reduce the number of calls to action and strengthen the remaining calls to action with a direct link to articles or actual nonprofit organization doing positive work.
Add “leading text” throughout the website to more explicitly direct the reader through the main points you want to get across.
Add an additional section about how endowment money is spent OR invested. Using the angle of divestment could be a stronger way of showing how large endowments are bad.
Remove the log/linear option from the grid of charts beacuse it’s unclear what additional value is provided by giving the “Log” option.


## Things to Include for Final Part III write-up:

- A few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.  Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. (Part III)
-  Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final project).  Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. (Part III)
- Add a link to your final data story (a direct link to Shorthand / StoryMap / etc.) placed in the final presentation spreadsheet.  Add the link next to your name in the spreadsheet, and update the title to reflect the working title for your presentation.  (Part III)


## Reflections

In crafting my final presentation, the part that was the hardest was addressing the "so what" portion of my topic. It's one thing to highlight that university endowments, particularly those of the 25 top-ranked universities in the United States, are astronmically high but it is harder to communicate effectively *why* this matters to the average person. My initial plan prior to part 2 was to focus on how large university endowments have a direct impact of the communities in which they reside by looking at university endowments relative to the median income of the zip codes in which they reside. However, when I started to create my visualizations for part 2 of my project, I realized that I wasn't able to tell the story that I wanted to tell because the median incomes were typically fairly high in university zip codes. Through my user research, one of my interviwees made a good point that, historically, university endowment sizes had been critiqued in terms of what they are invested in. This interviewee mentioned provided fossil fuel and apartheid-related divestment campaigns as examples of this existing work. This then prompted me to switch my "so what" portion of my project to focus on divestment instead of the area median income as the central "so what" piece of my project.
