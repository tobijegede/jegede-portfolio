## Overview of Project

Goal for this summary section:
- At a minimum, you should include the following: 

- A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a sentence or two that describes what you're interested in showing with your final project.
- A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  
-------------------------
Idea #1: The purpose of this project is to highlight the issue of algorithmic bias and how it impacts our daily lives and high-stakes arenas. The initial story arc that we developed in class is copied below in the next section to give an idea of the general mood that I expect readers to be in when they view my resulting website. I want to use a recidivism algorithm that already exists (the National Institutes of Justice (NIJ) recidivism challenge dataset) as a way of understanding the issues that arise with using blackbox algorithms to implement structural change and to use in high-stakes decision making processes. 

Idea #2: Don't Give Money to Your Alma Mater

Exposing high Education Endowment Sizes and How Elite Universities negatively impact the communities around them

If you're like me, you might receive constant emails, physical mail, and annual calls from your undergraduate institution asking you to donate money. The pleas are made in earnest and emphasize how much your donation fo $20 or more can help bring about meaningful change on your campus and assist future students. But, how true is this? Throughout my project, I want to explore what endowments are, how they are used, how they are marketed, and some action items readers can take after this. (1. stop donating to your undergrad institution if their endowment is over a certain size, 2. engage in local activism movements to encourage local senators to give money to state colleges, 3. Find other worthy causes that allow you to donate directly to individuals instead of to massive corporations.)


Top 20 universities in the US (according to US News and World Report 2022 - https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities): Princeton, Columbia, Harvard, MIT, Yale, Stanford, UChicago, UPenn, Caltech, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, Dartmouth, Brown, Vanderbilt, WUSTL, Cornell, Rice, Notre Dame, UCLA



Give Your Donation money to those who actually deserve it! 


Could instead look at doing something on endowments

Donâ€™t Give Back To Your Alma Mater
If you attended the top 20 schools in the US


If you went to the 


1. Size of the endowments at the top 20 schools
2. A graph of endowment per student population
3. Endowment to local area revenue comparison
4. Growth in endowment size over time
5. Data on what endowments are spent on
6. Private vs public schools and spending per student
7. Comparison of the size of the top 3 schools endowments and compare this to the GDP of various countries.

In addition to not spending money how they say they should, 
There is also a link between the vast explosion of university and gentrification in the areas that they sit in

## Data Sources

 To be successful in the final project, you'll need to get a copy of the data you'll need for your final project, or recreate it based on various sources.  Make sure in all cases to record your sources and cite these data sources appropriately. 

At a minimum, you should include the following: 

- A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
- A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 

----------------------------

The data sources I intend to use are the following:
1. Google Trends Data
2. NIJ Recidivism Data -- The National Institutes of Justice had a Recidivsm Forecasting Challenge that they ran, with the goal of 
   This data would be used to walk the user through the dangers of black-box algorithms that determine their life. Essentially, I would want to build a model that spits out a prediction for two similar individuals (who may differ on income and race) and how the model will predict two different outcomes for these individuals. Something like "with this black box model, you don't know why these decisions were made" -- and how can we uncover this mystery.




## Method and Medium

In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.  One option we've already discussed is building a story using your data using Shorthand - but this is my no means your only option.  


I plan on using Shorthand as my implementation strategy for this project.
