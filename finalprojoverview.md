## Overview of Project

Goal for this summary section:
- At a minimum, you should include the following: 

- A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a sentence or two that describes what you're interested in showing with your final project.
- A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  
-------------------------
The purpose of this project is to highlight the rapid growth of the endowments of the top 20 universities in the United States over the past decade and to emphasize how little of that money is actually used to benefit individual students and campus. Inspiration for this visual exploration of these inequities was gained from reading a WBUR article on inequities in college donations.[^1] Additionally, I want to make sure to highlight how these well-endowed universities grew, in some cases, at the expense of the communities in which they reside and that the money given for university endowments is typically untaxable and allowed to grow exponentially larger year or over year, even during the pandemic. Ultimtely, my call to action will be something like "Don't give money to your alma mater (if you attended a top 20 university in the US). Give to a worthier cause instead." 

Here's a view of the major elements of my story:



Idea #2: Don't Give Money to Your Alma Mater

Exposing high Education Endowment Sizes and How Elite Universities negatively impact the communities around them

If you're like me, you might receive constant emails, physical mail, and annual calls from your undergraduate institution asking you to donate money. The pleas are made in earnest and emphasize how much your donation fo $20 or more can help bring about meaningful change on your campus and assist future students. But, how true is this? Throughout my project, I want to explore what endowments are, how they are used, how they are marketed, and some action items readers can take after this. (1. stop donating to your undergrad institution if their endowment is over a certain size, 2. engage in local activism movements to encourage local senators to give money to state colleges, 3. Find other worthy causes that allow you to donate directly to individuals instead of to massive corporations.)


Top 20 universities in the US (according to US News and World Report 2022 - https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities): Princeton, Columbia, Harvard, MIT, Yale, Stanford, UChicago, UPenn, Caltech, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, Dartmouth, Brown, Vanderbilt, WUSTL, Cornell, Rice, Notre Dame, UCLA


Give Your Donation money to those who actually deserve it! 


Could instead look at doing something on endowments

Donâ€™t Give Back To Your Alma Mater

In addition to not spending money how they say they should, 
There is also a link between the vast explosion of university and gentrification in the areas that they sit in

## Initial Sketches 

<u> Initial Story Progression </u>

I want to start my data visualization website with an explanation of what an endowment is and some news highlights about the largest


1. Size of the endowments at the top 20 schools
2. A graph of endowment per student population
3. Endowment to local area revenue comparison
4. Growth in endowment size over time
5. Data on what endowments are spent on
6. Private vs public schools and spending per student
7. Comparison of the size of the top 3 schools endowments and compare this to the GDP of various countries.

## Data Sources

 To be successful in the final project, you'll need to get a copy of the data you'll need for your final project, or recreate it based on various sources.  Make sure in all cases to record your sources and cite these data sources appropriately. 

At a minimum, you should include the following: 

- A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
- A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 

----------------------------

The data sources I intend to use are the following:
1. **Endowment Data:** This data comes from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and is available for the period from 2011 to 2018. The datasets can be accessed at the following link: https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/Search?query=endowment&query2=endowment&resultType=all&page=1&sortBy=relevance&overlayDigestTableId=200947
2. **Global GDP Data:** country GDP data for comparisons, collected from the World Bank https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?end=2020&start=1960&view=chart and uploaded as "historical_gdp_gobal.csv" file on this github repo.
3. **Potential Dataset on Gentrification:** This website has some scrapable data potentially but will also likely need to get into the backend of this data by going directly to the Census ACS data.  (https://www.rentcafe.com/blog/rental-market/real-estate-news/top-20-gentrified-zip-codes/) -- will need to pull Census ACS data for this (and historical median household income, etc.)



## Method and Medium

In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.  One option we've already discussed is building a story using your data using Shorthand - but this is my no means your only option.  


I plan on using Shorthand as my implementation strategy for this project.
