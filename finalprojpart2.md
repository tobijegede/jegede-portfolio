# User Research

## User Research Protocol


Your user research protocol should clearly identify the following: 

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 


<u> Target Audience </u>

Given that my project is trying to examine university endowments, and ultimately convince my audience to not give money to their alma maters, my target audience are college graduates. Additionally, I wanted to interview individuals who had graduated from college recently  (within the last 5 years) for whom my message might reasonate due to the fact that they are more likely to be cash-strapped and therefore want to be judicious about how they spent their money. My message may be less successful or persuasive for individuals who graduated college over 10 years ago who are more like to have more discretionary funds to spend and therefore may want to spend that money on donating to their alma maters.


<u> Approach to Finding Representative Individuals to Interview </u>

  
  Demographic Information on each of my interviewees include:
  Gender
  Race
  Age
  Years Since College Graduation
  State of Residence
  Type of College Attended (Public vs Private)
  
 
<u> Interview Script </u>

In designing my user research protocol, I was primarily concerned with three main themes: Aesthetics & Layout , Logical Coherence, Effectiveness. As such, my interview script was broken doen as follows:


<u> Interview Script </u>

**Aesthetics & Layout: **

1. What are your initial reactions to the layout and logical structure of the website?
2. What are some of the things that are working about the overall layout/use of color?
3. What are some things that are confusing in the layout or use of color that you would want to see improved?

**Logical Coherence:**
4. Is the story that is being told clear?
5. If you were to provide a one sentence summary of 

Is there sufficient evidence presented that supports this main point?

What are some things that work well about the current design/information currently displayed?

What parts are confusing?

What parts for improvement do you think should be prioritized?

If not, What additional information would you need for the visualizations to be sufficiently persuasive?

Do you find the colors to be distracting or do they compliment the story?

Should there be a different color scheme used that would better convey the central message of the website?

Are the visualizations clear in what they are showing?

Are there any points where further explanation is needed?

What mood do you feel when going through the story? 

Does the website in its current form inspire you to learn more about college endowments?

Do you feel like youâ€™ve learning something from this website? 

- What problems are the most severe

Hi, 

My project

Is the story cohesive?
Are you able to clearly link the sections of the visualization together?
  
 
<u> Interview Findings  </u>

The findings for my interview are summarized below:
