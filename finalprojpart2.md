# User Research Protocol

## Target Audience 

Given that my project is trying to examine university endowments, and ultimately convince my audience to not give money to their alma maters, my target audience are college graduates. Additionally, I wanted to interview individuals who had graduated from college recently  (within the last 5 years) for whom my message might reasonate due to the fact that they are more likely to be cash-strapped and therefore want to be judicious about how they spent their money. My message may be less successful or persuasive for individuals who graduated college over 10 years ago who are more like to have more discretionary funds to spend and therefore may want to spend that money on donating to their alma maters.


## Approach to Finding Representative Individuals to Interview 

In line with the description above of my target audience, I sought out individuals who had recently graduated college and tried to find a few different ages, types of universities attended, demographics, and racial breakdowns. I reached out to family and friends fit these criteria. The information that I wanted to collect on my interview subjects were the following:

- Gender
- Race
- Age
- Years Since College Graduation
- Type of College Attended (Public vs Private)
- State of Residence
  

## Interview Script

In designing my user research protocol, I was primarily concerned with three main themes: Aesthetics & Layout , Logical Coherence, Persuasive Effectiveness. As such, my interview script was broken down as follows:

**Aesthetics & Layout:**

1. What are your initial reactions to the layout and logical structure of the website?
2. What are some of the things that are working about the overall layout/use of color? Do you find the colors to be distracting or do they compliment the story?
3. What are some things that are confusing in the layout or use of color that you would want to see improved?  
4. Are the visualizations clear in what they are showing? If not, what could be improved in the visualizations?

**Logical Coherence:**

5. Is the story that is being told clear? Are you able to clearly link the sections of the website together through the visualizations?
6. From a logical coherence perspective, what parts for improvement do you think should be prioritized?

**Persuasive Effectiveness:** 

7. Is there sufficient evidence presented in the website to support this main point? If not, what additional information would you need for the visualizations to be sufficiently persuasive?
8. Does the website in its current form inspire you to learn more about college endowments?
9. Do you feel like you’ve learned something from this website? 
10. Is there anything that you were hoping to learn through the website that you weren't able to learn, with the current way that the information is provided?

**Overall:**

11. Do you have any final thoughts or suggestions that weren't already covered in the previous questions?

The findings for my interview are summarized below:
  

| Interview Questions| Interviewee #1 <br> Gender: Female <br> Race: White  <br> Age: 26 <br> Years Since College Graduation : 4 <br> Type of College Attended (Public vs Private): Private <br>  State of Residence: PA | Interviewee #2 <br> Gender: Female <br> Race: Black  <br> Age: 25 <br> Years Since College Graduation : 3 <br> Type of College Attended (Public vs Private): Private <br>  State of Residence: NC | Interviewee #3 <br> Gender: Female <br> Race: Black  <br> Age: 27 <br> Years Since College Graduation : 5 <br> Type of College Attended (Public vs Private): Private <br>  State of Residence: IL |
| --------- | :-------------- | :-------------- |  :------------- |
| 1. What are your initial reactions to the layout and logical structure of the website? | Overall, the sections logically flow together. I was curious as to why you chose to only display the top 20 universities (in terms of endowment size). If you had more time for the analysis, I would be interested to see the top 200 or more colleges. Also, with this larger dataset, I would be curious to see deeper analysis into the difference between public and private universities' uses of endowments. Additionally, in the  argument about universities' influence on the median income in the zip codes in which they reside, I wonder if it might be more useful to show the endowment sizes relative to the state's median income. Universities often play a role in shaping the lives of people not just in their cities but in. their states as well. Also, maybe instead of focusing on median income, you could focus on what universities are investing their endowments in and tie this into exisiting conversations about divestment and historical divesment movements. | There is a logical flow in how your storyboard is structured. I like that there is not too much text to read and that it primarily makes use of visuals. Particularly, I like the inclusion of hte "Just How Large is $39 billlion part of the analysis. |  Flow makes a lot of sense; Like the definition of an endowment; The charts and putting it in context (how large is that money is very clear) |
|2. What are some of the things that are working about the overall layout/use of color? Do you find the colors to be distracting or do they compliment the story | The colors used are good and are not dstracting |  The red in the endowment is a little blurred and hard to read | Also agreed on the changing the colors that are emphasized — advised you to change this to being in orange instead|
|3.  What are some things that are confusing in the layout or use of color that you would want to see improved? |  nope (fix capitalization)       |.   (See Above)     | (See above)|
|4. Are the visualizations clear in what they are showing? If not, what could be improved in the visualizations? |   – in the map, emphasize the city-level information VS state bc it’s unclear what the emphasis should be (making an arugment about state level impact, then give state-level info), (change the title of the map to make it clearer). (Note: Originally the title on the Map was "Top 10 University Endowments & Their Median Incomes", which was a placeholder but also confusing for this user to interpret that "their" was in reference to in this case.    | No   | Visualizations = difference between linear and log; For the bar charts in the table, it would be helpful for the bars to include the times GDP inside; Rwanda has a very small GDP vs Harvard’s being too small; Multiple different countries that could be useful —  to show comparisons between (1:1 ratios)  — why Rwanda |
|5. Is the story that is being told clear? Are you able to clearly link the sections of the website together through the visualizations?| Yes, the logically flow of the website is clear, and the section headers help with making the story that is told clear  | Call to action is clear and the logic is clear     | Overall, yes you are able to easily link the various sections together|
|6. From a logical coherence perspective, what parts for improvement do you think should be prioritized?| The map at the end is the part that is still difficult to understand and needs some improvement.  |.  5. Where does endowment money go? this would be useful to have as well? (Could distract from academics)     |make the point and that it is difficult to find this information and it is not clear —> it’s very opquae about how it’s spent  |
|7. Is there sufficient evidence presented in the website to support this main point? If not, What additional information would you need for the visualizations to be sufficiently persuasive?| Similar to the above question, The map at the end is the part that is still difficult to understand and needs some improvement. I think the title needs to be clarified and also the relative median income or other measure to use should be clarified -- i.e. does it make more sense to focus on the city-level median income or on the median income of the state? Typically, universities have an impact beyond the city that they are located in, so perhaps it makes sense to also expand the median income context to cover a larger area than is currently being covered.  | Overall yes,but see above for potential improvements    | Yes, also see above for some suggestions. |
|8. Does the website in its current form inspire you to learn more about college endowments? | Yes!  | Yes! I may even be helpful to include links to investigative journalism pieces or something related to endowments that would allow readers to learn more about this topic   |.     Similarly, yes wanted to learn more and get resources to where I could learn more|
|9. Do you feel like you’ve learned something from this website? | Yes!  | Yes     |.       yes |
|10. Is there anything that you were hoping to learn through the website that you weren’t able to learn, with the current way that the information is provided? | breakdown endowments are invested (could help to strength the arugment)  |  As shown above, having more direction towards where to learn more about the topics discussed could be useful -- either in the call to action or in another section   | As mentioned above, more countries to compare their GDPS to (to make the selection of Rwanda seem less random) |
|11. Do you have any final thoughts or suggestions that weren’t already covered in the previous questions? | could inlcude in the call to action an actual list of nonprofits to donate to and how your donation would be used for the non-profits vs how it could be used for the university’s purposes  | Fix the capitalization in the call to action section (make sure that they all do or do not have periods at the end) | Show  income in a neighboring town town — and some additional articles that could be useful |





## Improvements For Part 3
**The key improvements and those that are most feasible to complete in the next week are:**
1. Fixing the colored, bolded parts of the endowment definition and other callouts throughout to a dark orange or other non-red color, as it is current choice of color makes the words appear to be a bit blurred.
2. Fix the map -- think about the reference point that you want to
3. Include links to articles or an example of "how endowments are spend" OR "an exploration of how endowments are invested" and some breakdown OR highlight that this information is typically not disclosed and anticipate this question for the reader, and present them with existing exploratory articles or news releases that can shed further light into this area and encourage them to learn more. Essentially, the question that came up across all of my interviews was about this question of "how is endowment money spent" and "where does it come from". Because I couldn't find a comprehensive dataset with this information anddidn't have enough time to scrape existing websites, I should at least provide a section addressing this point that has come up and explain why there isn't an exploration further into this. --> this isalos why this lobbying piece
4. Find potential non-profits or other examples of orgs to donate to instead of just talking about this call to action point broadly, in order to help readers start this exploratory process for themselves.
5. Another thing to change, in the table that I have displayed, is something that interviewee #3 mentioned -- add the number represented in the bar chart to the actual bar because, unless you hover over the bar, you can't tell what number it is supposed to represent. Also, adding additional "multiple comparisons" would be useful in helping to further contextualize the information shown and make the current selection of "rwanda" less random.
6. Also, making more of a story/main summary point as the title for my graphics could also get the main point across in each of my visualizations.
7. Adjust the color scheme
8. Reduce the number of calls to action and strength the call to action with a direct link to an actual nonprofit organization doing good work
9. Use canva or some other visualization technique (figma) as a way to display the GDP vs Endowment data (maybe pick three countries)
10. Also, make the "Why this matters" part of the visualization easier to understand so that the call to action is more convincing for readers
11. Add "leading text". Although the general flow of information is clear
12. Add the piece about how endowment money is spent OR about divestment --> use divestment as the important piece of why large endowments are bad --> possibly contect this to climate change INSTEAD of focusing on this like town vs gown, university wealth vs local community poverty comparison, as this would be in line with the sorts of discussions that are already happening.
13. Add a title to the table AND/OR maybe instead of using the table, use a series of smaller visualizations like (1 in 4 people) kind of thing instead, which could be clearer for the reader to understand.
