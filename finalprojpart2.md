# User Research

## User Research Protocol


Your user research protocol should clearly identify the following: 

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 


## Target Audience 

Given that my project is trying to examine university endowments, and ultimately convince my audience to not give money to their alma maters, my target audience are college graduates. Additionally, I wanted to interview individuals who had graduated from college recently  (within the last 5 years) for whom my message might reasonate due to the fact that they are more likely to be cash-strapped and therefore want to be judicious about how they spent their money. My message may be less successful or persuasive for individuals who graduated college over 10 years ago who are more like to have more discretionary funds to spend and therefore may want to spend that money on donating to their alma maters.


## Approach to Finding Representative Individuals to Interview 

In line with the description above of my target audience, I sought out individuals who had recently graduated college and tried to find a few different ages, types of universities attended, demographics, and racial breakdowns. I reached out to family and friends fit these criteria. The information that I wanted to collect on my interview subjects were the following:

- Gender
- Race
- Age
- Years Since College Graduation
- Type of College Attended (Public vs Private)
- State of Residence
  

## Interview Script

In designing my user research protocol, I was primarily concerned with three main themes: Aesthetics & Layout , Logical Coherence, Persuasive Effectiveness. As such, my interview script was broken down as follows:

**Aesthetics & Layout:**

1. What are your initial reactions to the layout and logical structure of the website?
2. What are some of the things that are working about the overall layout/use of color? Do you find the colors to be distracting or do they compliment the story?
3. What are some things that are confusing in the layout or use of color that you would want to see improved?  
4. Are the visualizations clear in what they are showing? If not, what could be improved in the visualizations?

**Logical Coherence:**

5. Is the story that is being told clear? Are you able to clearly link the sections of the website together through the visualizations?
6. From a logical coherence perspective, what parts for improvement do you think should be prioritized?

**Persuasive Effectiveness:** 

7. Is there sufficient evidence presented in the website to support this main point? If not, what additional information would you need for the visualizations to be sufficiently persuasive?
8. Are there any points where further explanation is needed?
9. Does the website in its current form inspire you to learn more about college endowments?
10. Do you feel like you’ve learned something from this website? 
11. Is there anything that you were hoping to learn through the website that you weren't able to learn, with the current way that the information is provided?

**Overall:**

12. Do you have any final thoughts or suggestions that weren't already covered in the previous questions?

  
 
## Interview Findings  

The findings for my interview are summarized below:
  

| Interview Questions| Interviewee #1 <br> Gender: Female <br> Race: White  <br> Age: 26 <br> Years Since College Graduation : 4 <br> Type of College Attended (Public vs Private): Private <br>  State of Residence: PA | Interviewee #2 <br> Gender: Female <br> Race: Black  <br> Age: 25 <br> Years Since College Graduation : 3 <br> Type of College Attended (Public vs Private): Private <br>  State of Residence: NC | Interviewee #3 <br> Gender: Female <br> Race: Black  <br> Age: 27 <br> Years Since College Graduation : 5 <br> Type of College Attended (Public vs Private): Private <br>  State of Residence: IL |
| --------- | :-------------- | :-------------- |  :------------- |
| 1. What are your initial reactions to the layout and logical structure of the website? | logically the arugments flow, only have top 20 universities (more interesting to see top 200 or public vs private universities) -- argument about universities (what if universitites played a bigger role than the cities that they're in ; hold more power than their alumni ;  organize for what university should spend endowment on (divestment focus) --> usful | blah blah blah | blah blah blah |
|2. What are some of the things that are working about the overall layout/use of color? Do you find the colors to be distracting or do they compliment the story | The colors used are good and are not dstracting     |.   ok     |.       ok |
|3.  What are some things that are confusing in the layout or use of color that you would want to see improved? |  nope (fix capitalization)       |.   ok     |.       ok |
|4. Are the visualizations clear in what they are showing? If not, what could be improved in the visualizations? |   – in the map, emphasize the city-level information VS state bc it’s unclear what the emphasis should be (making an arugment about state level impact, then give state-level info), (change the title of the map to make it clearer). (Note: Originally the title on the Map was "Top 10 University Endowments & Their Median Incomes", which was a placeholder but also confusing for this user to interpret that "their" was in reference to in this case.    |.   ok     |.       ok |
|5. Is the story that is being told clear? Are you able to clearly link the sections of the website together through the visualizations?| Yes, the logically flow of the website is clear, and the section headers help with making the story that is told clear  |.   ok     |.       ok |
|6. From a logical coherence perspective, what parts for improvement do you think should be prioritized?| The map at the end is the part that is still difficult to understand and needs some improvement.  |.   ok     |.       ok |
|7. Is there sufficient evidence presented in the website to support this main point? If not, What additional information would you need for the visualizations to be sufficiently persuasive?| Similar to the above question, The map at the end is the part that is still difficult to understand and needs some improvement. I think the title needs to be clarified and also the relative median income or other measure to use should be clarified -- i.e. does it make more sense to focus on the city-level median income or on the median income of the state? Typically, universities have an impact beyond the city that they are located in, so perhaps it makes sense to also expand the median income context to cover a larger area than is currently being covered.  |.   ok     |.       ok |
|8. Does the website in its current form inspire you to learn more about college endowments? | Yes!  |.   ok     |.       ok |
|9. Do you feel like you’ve learned something from this website? | Yes!  |.   ok     |.       ok |
|10. Is there anything that you were hoping to learn through the website that you weren’t able to learn, with the current way that the information is provided? | breakdown endowments are invested (could help to strength the arugment)  |.   ok     |.       ok |
|11. Do you have any final thoughts or suggestions that weren’t already covered in the previous questions? | could inlcude in the call to action an actual list of nonprofits to donate to and how your donation would be used for the non-profits vs how it could be used for the university’s purposes  |.   ok     |.       ok |





## Improvements For Part 3
The key improvements (and those that are most feasible to complete in the next week are)
1. Fixing the colored, bolded parts of the endowment definition and other callouts throughout to a dark orange or other non-red color, as it is current choice of color makes the words appear to be a bit blurred.
2. Fix the map -- think about the reference point that you want to
3. Include links to articles or an example of "how endowments are spend" OR "an exploration of how endowments are invested" and some breakdown OR highlight that this information is typically not disclosed and anticipate this question for the reader, and present them with existing exploratory articles or news releases that can shed further light into this area and encourage them to learn more. Essentially, the question that came up across all of my interviews was about this question of "how is endowment money spent" and "where does it come from". Because I couldn't find a comprehensive dataset with this information anddidn't have enough time to scrape existing websites, I should at least provide a section addressing this point that has come up and explain why there isn't an exploration further into this. --> this isalos why this lobbying piece
4. Find potential non-profits or other examples of orgs to donate to instead of just talking about this call to action point broadly, in order to help readers start this exploratory process for themselves.
