# Wireframe/Storyboarding

I completed my storyboarding in Shorthand. My rough outline and storyboarding on Shorthand can be found at the following link:

# User Research

## User Research Protocol


Your user research protocol should clearly identify the following: 

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 


<u> Target Audience </u>

Given that my project is trying to examine university endowments, and ultimately convince my audience to not give money to their alma maters, my target audience are college graduates. Additionally, I wanted to interview individuals who had graduated from college recently  (within the last 5 years) for whom my message might reasonate due to the fact that they are more likely to be cash-strapped and therefore want to be judicious about how they spent their money. My message may be less successful or persuasive for individuals who graduated college over 10 years ago who are more like to have more discretionary funds to spend and therefore may want to spend that money on donating to their alma maters.


<u> Approach to Finding Representative Individuals to Interview </u>

In line with the description above of my target audience, I sought out individuals who had recently graduated college and tried to find a few different ages, types of universities attended, demographics, and racial breakdowns. I reached out to family and friends fit these criteria. The information that I wanted to collect on my interview subjects were the following:

- Gender
- Race
- Age: 26
- Years Since College Graduation: 4
- Type of College Attended (Public vs Private): Private 
- State of Residence: PA
  
 
<u> Interview Script </u>

In designing my user research protocol, I was primarily concerned with three main themes: Aesthetics & Layout , Logical Coherence, Persuasive Effectiveness. As such, my interview script was broken down as follows:

<u> Interview Script </u>

**Aesthetics & Layout:**

1. What are your initial reactions to the layout and logical structure of the website?
2.  logically the arugments flow, only have top 20 universities (more interesting to see top 200 or public vs private universities) -- argument about universities (what if universitites played a bigger role than the cities that they're in -- hold more power than their 
- alumni -- organize for what university should spend endowment on (divestment focus) --> usful 


4. What are some of the things that are working about the overall layout/use of color? Do you find the colors to be distracting or do they compliment the story?
"colors are good" =


6. What are some things that are confusing in the layout or use of color that you would want to see improved?
"estemed formal pupil) - nope (fix capitalization)  --



8. Are the visualizations clear in what they are showing? If not, what could be improved in the visualizations?

-- in the map, emphasize the city-level information VS state bc it's unclear what the emphasis should be (making an arugment about state level impact, then give state-level info), (change the title of the map to make it clearer)



10. Should there be a different color scheme used that would better convey the central message of the website?


11. From a visual perspective, what parts for improvement do you think should be prioritized?

**Logical Coherence:**

7. Is the story that is being told clear? Are you able to clearly link the sections of the website together through the visualizations?
8. If you were to provide a one sentence summary of what you're seeing, what would it be?
9. From a logical coherence perspective, what parts for improvement do you think should be prioritized?

**Persuasive Effectiveness:** 

10. Is there sufficient evidence presented in the website to support this main point? If not, What additional information would you need for the visualizations to be sufficiently persuasive?

- clear linkages
12. Are there any points where further explanation is needed?

map ()


14. Does the website in its current form inspire you to learn more about college endowments?
15. - yes
16. Do you feel like youâ€™ve learned something from this website? 
17. -yes 
18. Is there anything that you were hoping to learn through the website that you weren't able to learn, with the current way that the information is provided?
- breakdown endowments are invested (could help to strength the arugment)

**Overall:**

15. Do you have any final thoughts or suggestions that weren't already covered in the previous questions?

- could inlcude in the call to action an actual list of nonprofits to donate to and how your donation would be used for the non-profits vs how it could be used for the university's purposes
