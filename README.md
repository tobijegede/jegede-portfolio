# About Me
Hi there! My name is **Tobi** and I'm a second-year masters of public policy and data analytics at Carnegie Mellon University. My pronouns are **she/her**. I'm originally from Maryland but spent the two years prior to graduate school working as a Compliance Analyst for an investment bank in NYC before relocating to Pittsburgh for graduate school. While in my previous role, I saw how powerful data analytics could be for better risk detection efforts at the firm and was curious about how analytics tools could be brought to bear on pressing public policy questions. In order to marry my burgeoning interest in data analytics with my prior undergraduate experience in public policy, I decided to come to Carnegie Mellon University. Last summer (and this fall), I've gotten the opportunity to see data analytics work in service of the public interest through an internship with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). I'd like to bring the skills that I've learned in graduate school both in and out of the classroom to a civic technology focused organization in a full-time role. There are so many issues in need of solving and I'd love to be part of making a positive change in the world.


# What I Hope to Learn

I am notoriously bad at visualizing data creatively and so, at a minimum, I want to be able to better understand how to critique my own work and figure out easy steps for improving how I visualize data through this course. Because working in civic technology and in advocacy more broadly are career goals of mine, being able to translate complex findings in data into a quick visual that is legible to the public is a critical skill I would like to improve upon. I also want to be able to build a portflio of work that shows how I have worked on data visualization tasks. Finally, most of my coursework at CMU has been focused on learning coding languages and machine learning and so I wanted to access the more creative side of my brain by taking this class. Through my work outside of the classroom, I've seen how great coding work can be undermined by poor visualizations and poor storytelling and so I would also like to learn how to become a better visual storyteller with the help of this course.
